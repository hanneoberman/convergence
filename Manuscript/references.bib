  abstract = {Praise for the Fourth Edition  "The book follows faithfully the style of the original edition. The approach is heavily motivated by real-world time series, and by developing a complete approach to model building, estimation, forecasting and control."---Mathematical Reviews Bridging classical models and modern topics, the Fifth Edition of Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control maintains a balanced presentation of the tools for modeling and analyzing time series. Also describing the latest developments that have occurred in the field over the past decade through applications from areas such as business, finance, and engineering, the Fifth Edition continues to serve as one of the most influential and prominent works on the subject. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition provides a clearly written exploration of the key methods for building, classifying, testing, and analyzing stochastic models for time series and describes their use in five important areas of application: forecasting; determining the transfer function of a system; modeling the effects of intervention events; developing multivariate dynamic models; and designing simple control schemes. Along with these classical uses, the new edition covers modern topics with new features that include:  A redesigned chapter on multivariate time series analysis with an expanded treatment of Vector Autoregressive, or VAR models, along with a discussion of the analytical tools needed for modeling vector time series An expanded chapter on special topics covering unit root testing, time-varying volatility models such as ARCH and GARCH, nonlinear time series models, and long memory models Numerous examples drawn from finance, economics, engineering, and other related fields The use of the publicly available R software for graphical illustrations and numerical calculations along with scripts that demonstrate the use of R for model building and forecasting Updates to literature references throughout and new end-of-chapter exercises Streamlined chapter introductions and revisions that update and enhance the exposition  Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition is a valuable real-world reference for researchers and practitioners in time series analysis, econometrics, finance, and related fields. The book is also an excellent textbook for beginning graduate-level courses in advanced statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, engineering, and physics.},

  abstract = {For many data sets, especially for non mandatory surveys, missing data are a common problem. Deleting units that are not completely observed and using only the remaining units is a popular, easy to implement approach in this case. This can possibly introduce severe bias if the strong assumption of a missing pattern that is completely at random (MCAR) is not fulfilled (see for example Rubin (1987)). Imputing the missing values can overcome this problem. However, ad hoc methods like, e.g., mean imputation can destroy the correlation between the variables. Furthermore, imputing missing values only once (single imputation) generally doesn't account for the fact that the imputed values are only estimates for the true values. After the imputation process, they are treated like truly observed values leading to an underestimation of the variance in the data and by this to p values that are too significant.},

This paper is devoted to parametric empirical methods testing the stationarity. We compare the methods of Gelman and Rubin, Yu and Mykland, Raftery and Lewis, Geweke, Riemann sums and the subsampling. These methods are tested using three examples: the simple case of the generation of a normal random variable, a bivariate mixture of normal models and a practical case taken from hydrology, namely the shifting level model. Results show that no method works in every case. We therefore suggest a joint use of these techniques. The importance of determining carefully the burn-in period is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Several methods have been proposed for creating multiple imputations and most of these methods assume that the data are missing at random (MAR). However, limited diagnostic tools are available to check whether the imputations created by these methods are reasonable. This article develops a set of diagnostic tools based on certain conditional distributions of the observed and imputed values. These conditional distributions should be similar if the assumed model for creating multiple imputations is a good fit. The tools are formulated in terms of numerical summaries and graphical displays and could be easily implemented using the standard complete data software packages. For implementing these methods the exact nature of the model used by the imputer is not needed. The method is illustrated using a data set with large number of variables of different types with varying amount of missing values.},

These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results.

  abstract = {Incomplete data are ubiquitous in social sciences; as a consequence, available data are inefficient (ineffective) and often biased. In the literature, multiple imputation is known to be the standard method to handle missing data. While the theory of multiple imputation has been known for decades, the implementation is difficult due to the complicated nature of random draws from the posterior distribution. Thus, there are several computational algorithms in software: Data Augmentation (DA), Fully Conditional Specification (FCS), and Expectation-Maximization with Bootstrapping (EMB). Although the literature is full of comparisons between joint modeling (DA, EMB) and conditional modeling (FCS), little is known about the relative superiority between the MCMC algorithms (DA, FCS) and the non-MCMC algorithm (EMB), where MCMC stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo. Based on simulation experiments, the current study contends that EMB is a confidence proper (confidence-supporting) multiple imputation algorithm without between-imputation iterations; thus, EMB is more user-friendly than DA and FCS.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics, but it can be challenging to monitor the convergence of an iterative stochastic algorithm. In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R{\textasciicircum} of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional R{\textasciicircum} will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

  abstract = {A sequential regression or chained equations imputation approach uses a Gibbs sampling-type iterative algorithm that imputes the missing values using a sequence of conditional regression models. It is a flexible approach for handling different types of variables and complex data structures. Many simulation studies have shown that the multiple imputation inferences based on this procedure have desirable repeated sampling properties. However, a theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specification of a set of conditional regression models may not be compatible with a joint distribution of the variables being imputed. Hence, the convergence properties of the iterative algorithm are not well understood. This article develops conditions for convergence and assesses the properties of inferences from both compatible and incompatible sequence of regression models. The results are established for the missing data pattern where each subject may be missing a value on at most one variable. The sequence of regression models are assumed to be empirically good fit for the data chosen by the imputer based on appropriate model diagnostics. The results are used to develop criteria for the choice of regression models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
