  abstract = {For many data sets, especially for non mandatory surveys, missing data are a common problem. Deleting units that are not completely observed and using only the remaining units is a popular, easy to implement approach in this case. This can possibly introduce severe bias if the strong assumption of a missing pattern that is completely at random (MCAR) is not fulfilled (see for example Rubin (1987)). Imputing the missing values can overcome this problem. However, ad hoc methods like, e.g., mean imputation can destroy the correlation between the variables. Furthermore, imputing missing values only once (single imputation) generally doesn't account for the fact that the imputed values are only estimates for the true values. After the imputation process, they are treated like truly observed values leading to an underestimation of the variance in the data and by this to p values that are too significant.},

In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R{\textasciicircum} of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws.

In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.
